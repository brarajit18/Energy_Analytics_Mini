In this Project, I will guide you through the load forecasting benchmark model development based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). This model was also used at Global Energy Forecasting Competitions (GefCom) as a baseline model. I will explain the basics behind the feature engineering step by step.

How to model the load with MLR?
MLR is the most widely used method for load forecasting and achieves remarkable results in industry and on load forecasting competitions. Although MLR as an algorithm is very easy and simple to understand at first, modeling various problems is not that straight-forward. You cannot just put something into the model as with Neural Networks and expect it to magically work.
MLR is a linear model, but this does not mean you cannot model non-linear dependencies. All you need is an appropriate feature engineering in order to linearize the problem.

Prerequisites to fully understand this notebook:

I strongly suggest reading at least the first 120 pages of an excellent and free book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning.
If you haven't watched Andrew Ng's ML course, you have to watch it now. Watch at least the first part about MLR.
This book can help, if you are a beginner.
